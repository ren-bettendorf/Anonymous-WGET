The program works as expected I believe, 

awget expects: ./awget <url> [-c chainlist] 

If no chainlist file is given it looks for chaingang.txt 

ss expects like the following: 
./ss [-p port] 
If no port is given it attempts to bind to 9000 
For the chainlist, it expects the following format:
# of stones
IP PORT 
IP PORT 
etc...

Also, chainlist will check that the initial number > 0, that the number of entries matches the given number, and there is a space for each entry.
